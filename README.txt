This app makes a call to the wikipedia api with the search term that is entered. If no search term is entered, the app opens a random article.

Results and search bar animate when hovered-over or clicked-on using css effects. If you enter a search term that returns no results, an alert box will you inform you that your search returned no results.

Made this app to further practice changing the DOM based on data returned from an ajax GET request. Also learned a little about CSS animations.
